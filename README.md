# Project Information & Citing Sources

Time Taken on This Assignment:
  25 hours

In doing this homework I used the following sources:

1. Sources I don't need to mention
2. Authorized sources
   
   ChatGPT: information about prompts:
    
    (for db.ml)
     - I used ChatGPT in this section to improve the performance and quality of my levenshtein distance based fuzzy search algorithm (the levenshtein function in this file). 
     When I originally wrote the code, I had it about 80% complete but
     it had some logic errors and I felt like it was not the best
     performance wise.
    
    (for json_util.ml)
    - I was confused about the syntax to construct Yojson objects and used ChatGPT
    to debug syntax errors in my entry_to_json and db_to_json functions.

3. Unauthorized sources
